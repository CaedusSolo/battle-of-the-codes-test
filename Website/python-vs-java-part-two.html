                This segment is pretty straightforward--- we will compare Python
                and Java's syntax and readability. For this part, there is no
                clear winner, since it is subjective. Although Python's syntax
                is easier to understand and read, we cannot really rank them
                since again, it is a matter of preference.

                From the table above, we can deduce that Python's syntax is
                clean, clear and concise. Python's syntax emphasizes
                readability, and reduces cost of program maintenance. Due to
                this, Python is a popular choice for beginners that are just
                starting out learning to code.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Java on the other hand, has a more verbose syntax, with
                semicolons, curly braces, and explicit type declarations.
                Although some people find its strict syntax helpful for catching
                errors early on, others consider it less readable. Java's syntax
                can be very intimidating for beginners because of its verbosity.

                Python will have to take a backseat this time, as Java has the
                upper hand when it comes to performance.
              </h2>
              <p>But why is that? Let's see.</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Python is an <b>interpreted language</b>, meaning that the
                Python Interpreter reads and executes a Python file line by line
                during runtime. This introduces overhead and thus slows down the
                execution speed.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Other than that, Python has limited support for multithreading,
                due to the

                time.

              <br />
              <p>
                As a result, while Python is a good choice for most
                applications, it is not optimal for high-performance computing
                and real-time systems.

                <b>first compiled by the Java compiler into bytecode</b>, and
                then the bytecode is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
                The compilation process allows Java to optimize code beforehand
                which leads to quicker execution. Also, as discussed in the
                introduction to Java section, the JVM uses the

              As seen above, although Python can technically be used in loads of
              apps, it truly shines in the fields of machine learning and web
              development.
